the project will implement the BAS layer of the smart building system.
the fucos of the BAS layer is to provide a server application that act
as a central hub to mediate between software agents responsible for communication with the actual hardware device.

## description
### Management and Central Hub
The central hub is a server application that serves mainly as a host for software
agents representing the devices. It will provide an efficient mechanism to receive
events from sensors and dispatch these events to relevant controllers.

### Events
The system will enable devices to generate and send custom events. Events will
be generated by sensor agents and will be consumed by controller agents.
An event will consist of a type/topic, location info and arbitrary agent event
specific payload.

### Devices
The system will enable an operator to configure and install software agents that
mediate communication with external hardware devices.
